# useful, simple commands

# build a single-file c program in a.out
# product executable is named a.out
gcc source.c
clang source.c

# execute a.out
# use ./ prefix because your current dir is probably not in your $PATH
./a.out

# build & execute in one command
gcc source.c; ./a.out
clang source.c; ./a.out

# build a single-file c program with a chosen name
gcc name.c -o name
clang name.c -o name

# build & exec in one command with chosen name
gcc name.c -o name; ./name
clang name.c -o name; ./name

# build a single-file c program whose name is the stem of the source name
src=name.c; gcc $src -o ${src%%.c}
src=name.c; clang $src -o ${src%%.c}

# build & exec in one command
src=name.c; exe=${src%%.c}; gcc $src -o $exe; ./$exe
src=name.c; exe=${src%%.c}; clang $src -o $exe; ./$exe
