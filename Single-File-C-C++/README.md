# Simple C & C++ Build Environments

It's easy to write and build single-file C and C++ programs which allow you
to do simple or complex expriments with these languages.

A single-file program contains a main() function and any other code that you want to test.

You can also include files accessing any libraries that are installed at the system level
on the machine you're using and use those resources in your single-line program.
